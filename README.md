# xxo

A neural network trained to play xxo by playing against scripted agents, using keras and qlearning4k.

Just run

    learn-and-play-xxo.py

which will first train the network and then you can play against it.

qlearning4k can be found here:

xxo works fine with python2.7. With python3, qtlearning4k throws an error with certain (newer) keras versions, see also: https://github.com/farizrahman4u/qlearning4k/issues/22
